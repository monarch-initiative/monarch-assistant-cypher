##### 2 - Define Agents
########################

# StreamlitKani agents are Kani agents and work the same
# We must subclass StreamlitKani instead of Kani to get the Streamlit UI
# define an engine to use (see Kani documentation for more info)
engine = OpenAIEngine(os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"], model="gpt-4-1106-preview")


# We also have to define a function that returns a dictionary of agents to serve
# Agents are keyed by their name, which is what the user will see in the UI
def get_agents():
    return {
        "Monarch Assistant (2.0)": {
            "agent": MonarchAgent(engine),

                                        I'm the Monarch Assistant, an AI chatbot with access to the [Monarch Inititive](https://monarchinitiative.org) biomedical knowledgebase. I can search for information on diseases, genes, and phenotypes. Here are some things you might try asking:

                                        - What is the genetic basis of Cystic Fibrosis?
                                        - What symptoms are associated with Fanconi Anemia?
                                        - Which symptoms are shared by two or more forms of Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia?
                                        
                                        Please note that I am a research preview, and this information should not be used for diagnoses, clinical decision making, or other medical applications.
